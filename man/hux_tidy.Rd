\arguments{
\item{tidyDf}{A dataframe with row groupings (as a set of columns) and column
groupings (as a set of columns) and data, where the data is in a tidy
format with a row per "cell" or cell group.}

\item{rowGroupVars}{A dplyr::vars(...) column specification which will define how
rows are grouped}

\item{colGroupVars}{A dplyr::vars(...) column specification with defines how columns
will be grouped}

\item{missing}{If there is no content for a given rowGroup / colGroup
combination then this character will be used as a placeholder}

\item{na}{If there are NA contents then this character will be used.}

\item{displayRedundantColumnNames}{if there is one column per column group
the name of that column may be irrelevant (e.g. if there is a `col_name`,
`value` fully tidy format) and `col_name` is in the `colGroupVars` list
then the name of the column `value` is redundant and not displayed by
default. However sometimes you want to display this if you have named it as
something specific e.g. including the units. If there is more than one
column per `colGroup` the column titles are needed and kept.}

\value{
a huxtable table
}
\description{
The assumption here is that the input data is a long format tidy dataframe
with both rows and columns specified by values of the `rowGroupVars` and
`colGroupVars` columns. The long format (sparse) table is translated into a
nested tree of rows (using `rowGroupVars`) and a nested tree of columns (from
`colGroupVars`). Individual data items are placed in the cell intersecting
these two trees. If there are multiple matches an additional layer of grouping
is added to the columns.
